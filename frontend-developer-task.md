# React Front-End Developer

## The Project

As part of your application for the Front-End developer position we would like you
to put together the following project. We would like you to build a front-end application
using React that can consume a REST API of your choice.

You can either consume one of the following APIs, or you can pick one of your choice:

- Display a list of upcoming events using the [TicketMaster](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/) API
- Provide a searchable library using the [IconFinder](https://developer.iconfinder.com/reference/overview-1) API
- List cocktails and their ingredients using the [CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
- Provide a searchable music library using the [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) API
- Show recent news and stories listed from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
- Provide an image search using the [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/) API

## User Interface

Your application should present an interactive user interface with the following features:

- Show a list of data consumed via your chose API.
  This could be a list of recent data, or you could provide a search 
  function to establish a set of data to display. 

- Use an appropriate design format for each item you are displaying.
  This may include an image, text, or icons, and it can
  be listed as list or a grid.
  
- This isn't required, but if you want to go further, you could show more details
  of an individual item if the users clicks on it. This could expand within the existing
  view, open a sub-view or go to another page. If necessary, ensure the user can go back
  to the list view.
