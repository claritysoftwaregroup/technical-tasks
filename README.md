# Clarity Software Group Technical Tasks

## Why a technical task?

Historically when companies recruit for software engineers they are asking a set of questions,
involving specific features of a language or a framework. We are more interested into how
a person approaches a problem and what they can produce.

This is your chance to show us what you are capable of and for us to assess your abilities
as well as getting a glimpse of which areas you might need improvement in case we hire you so 
we can help you progress in your career at Clarity Software Group.

Please, choose a task from below that is most appropriate for the role you are applying.

## Tasks

- [React Front-End Developer](frontend-developer-task.md)
- [React Native Mobile Developer](mobile-developer-task.md)

## How long should I spend

It's entirely up to you how much time you spend, and feel free to put 
your own spin and creativity on it.

## What happens after you have completed the task

When you complete the task, and you are happy with the solution you will 
have to publish your code to a GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab repository so that we
can review your work.

We would also like you to provide:

- Clear instructions on how to install your application
- How to Run it
